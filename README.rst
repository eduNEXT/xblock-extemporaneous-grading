`XBlock`_ is the Open edX component architecture for building custom learning
interactive components.

You can see the Extemporaneous Grading component in action in the XBlock
Workbench. Running the Workbench requires having docker running.

.. code::

    git clone git@github.com:eduNEXT/xblock-extemporaneous-grading
    virtualenv venv/
    source venv/bin/activate
    cd xblock-extemporaneous-grading
    make upgrade
    make install
    make dev.run

Once the process is done, you can interact with the Extemporaneous Grading
XBlock in the Workbench by navigating to http://localhost:8000
